# deep_numerology
In this program we train a neural network to transelate an english word by its numerology value. From Wikipedia: "...It is also the study of the numerical value of the letters in words, names, and ideas."
For example, we can use the following dictionay (similar to hebrew (Gimatria): a=1, b=2,...,j=10,k=20,...,s=100,t=200,z=800.
For Example, the numerology value of the word "hello" is 133 since 8+5+30+30+60=133.  
  
We used [this Tensorflow tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l02c01_celsius_to_fahrenheit.ipynb#scrollTo=y_WQEM5MGmg3) as a template for our program.
