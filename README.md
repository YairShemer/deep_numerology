# deep_numerology
In this program we train a neural network to transelate an english word by its numerology value. From Wikipedia: "...It is also the study of the numerical value of the letters in words, names, and ideas."
For example, we can use the following dictionay (similar to hebrew (Gimatria): a=1, b=2,...,j=10,k=20,...,s=100,t=200,z=800.
For Example, the numerology value of the word "hello" is 133 since 8+5+30+30+60=133.
